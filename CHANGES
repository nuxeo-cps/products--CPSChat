- Fixed #1643 : The chat area spits error pages when a user is not sending
  messages.
- Stopped empty messages to be sent in the chat area since they are useless and
  users may also misuse it. So now when a user "Submit" if there isn't any
  message in the input area, no empty line will appear in the chat area.
